# Custom LLVM Toolchain

This repository holds a custom LLVM toolchain which implements additional
backend targets for "experimental" CPU designs and other research projects.

The README will be updated with more details as the development continues and
it becomes clearer what the toolchain will look like. Below is an excerpt from
the original LLVM project readme.

----

This directory and its sub-directories contain source code for LLVM,
a toolkit for the construction of highly optimized compilers,
optimizers, and run-time environments.

The README briefly describes how to get started with building LLVM.
For more information on how to contribute to the LLVM project, please
take a look at the
[Contributing to LLVM](https://llvm.org/docs/Contributing.html) guide.

### Overview

Welcome to the LLVM project!

The LLVM project has multiple components. The core of the project is
itself called "LLVM". This contains all of the tools, libraries, and header
files needed to process intermediate representations and converts it into
object files.  Tools include an assembler, disassembler, bitcode analyzer, and
bitcode optimizer.  It also contains basic regression tests.

C-like languages use the [Clang](http://clang.llvm.org/) front end.  This
component compiles C, C++, Objective-C, and Objective-C++ code into LLVM bitcode
-- and from there into object files, using LLVM.

Other components include:
the [libc++ C++ standard library](https://libcxx.llvm.org),
the [LLD linker](https://lld.llvm.org), and more.
